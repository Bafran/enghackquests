                    As incoming students starting our journey at the University of Waterloo, we had all heard about the infamous
                    tales describing the reign of the Canadian geese on campus. So, when we were challenged to design something at EngHacks 2021, we knew that we had to create an experience
                    that would allow anyone, anywhere to witness these stories come to life in the comfort of their home. Waterloo Goose Chase will put you in the shoes of an engineering student
                    fleeing from the fearsome Canadian geese populating campus, all while attempting to dodge the many obstacles
                    typically encountered in their time at university. A game like no other, now you too can experience the thrill of being hunted down by the resident birds on campus.
