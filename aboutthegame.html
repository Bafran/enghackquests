        <h1>About the game</h1>
        <p>As incoming students starting our journey at the University of Waterloo, we had all heard about the infamous
            tales describing the reign of the Canadian geese on campus. </p>
        <p>So, when we were challenged to design something at EngHacks 2021, we knew that we had to create an experience
            that would allow anyone, anywhere to witness these stories come to life in the comfort of their home.</p>
        <p>Waterloo Goose Chase will put you in the shoes of an engineering student
            fleeing from the fearsome Canadian geese populating campus, all while attempting to dodge the many obstacles
            typically encountered in their time at university.</p>
        <p>A game like no other, now you too can experience the thrill of being hunted down by the resident birds on campus. </p>
